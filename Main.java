The following is going to occur in this file:
- 4 Humans will be declared
- A Knight will be instanciated
- A Wizard will be instanciated
- The Knight will be cloned and it's name will be changed
- Check if: the Knight != Wizard, and if so the clone will be moved
- The Wizard will be cloned
- Check if: the Wizard clone == the original Wizard, and if so the clone will be moved
- The total # of humans in the world will be printed
- The descriptions of the humans will be printed
